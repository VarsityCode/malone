          <p>The technical job market is more interested in what you can actually build than a GPA or a certificate. The best technical resume isn't a piece of paper. It's a website on the internet, and after this class you'll have 12 of them.</p>

        <p>As a class, we will work on our code on GitHub (it's kind of like the Google Docs of code).</p>

          <h4>Will there be homework?</h4>
          <p>The goal of our course isn't a grade, but growth. </p>
          <p>We give students assignments and projects to do between classes that allow them to be creative, have fun, and enjoy learning how to build their own sites.</p>

          <h4>What pre-requisites do you recommend?</h4>
          <p>The biggest pre-requisite is enthusiasm. The biggest indicator for success is an excitement about the course itself. If you are excited about learning to code or creating your own website
          you will be primed to succeed.</p>
          <p>Technically speaking, a basic understanding of comptuers is expected: students should be familiar with how to use the internet and create files and folders.</p>

          <p>
            Yes, you will need to bring a personal laptop computer to each class. We will help your student setup their computer in class so they can have the tools to build at home.

            14 students per class or 1 teacher for every 7 students. Both teachers are present for every class.
          </p>
          <p>Lab partners are similar in age, which allows each lab group to progress at a rate they are comfortable with.</p>

            At the end of each course, students will have the opportunity to present their capstone websites in an auditorium setting to anyone they would like to attend. We'd love to have you see what they have built at the end of the course.
